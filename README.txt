@Description:
A VB.NET app which simulate a “House Automation system” with 4 control panel interfaces. 
We focused on the usability and the functionality of the interface 
and not on the design, and as the test scenarios with real random 
users demonstrated, our App fulfilled all the characteristics of a 
good Man-Machine Interface because everyone could use it easily without a previous knowledge.
